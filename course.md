# Course Setup

Welcome young cadet! This will guide you through setting up for the course. Why bother? Well here are some awesome benefits you'll get:

- Never deal with Courseworks homeworks upload
- Have your homework graded *instantly* (or as soon as the robot TA gets to it)
- See your code in its beautiful form and have TAs look and comment at specific lines

This is done through Jarvis, GitHub, and (optionally) Scoreboard.


## GitHub

GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service that. It makes it easy to
collaborate and host code all while using Git either in a GUI or on the command
line. It also has a very powerful API that we've made use to make our jobs
easier.

## Jarvis

Jarvis [http://jarvis.xyz](http://jarvis.xyz) is a proprietary homework submission system built for this class. It helps you set up your repositories and teams on GitHub, listens for when you submit your homework, and helps you grade them automatically in our testing environment, giving you really quick feedback. (For the geekier ones among you, Jarvis is the front-end to our Continuous Integration service)

## Scoreboard

Scoreboard is a service provided by Jarvis that allows you to compete with other students based on the score tally of your homeworks. It is totally experimental and optional, but we have a feeling that you want to have some fun with this. To opt-in, check the checkbox for Scoreboard when registering on Jarvis.

## Setup

### Create a GitHub Account

If you don't already have a GitHub acccount, sign up for one here: [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join). If you already have one, there's no need to create an additional one for this class. In fact, please don't do that -- it will create way more trouble for you. We built this to encourage you to own your first GitHub account.

### Register with Jarvis

Now that you have a GitHub account, you need to add yourself to Jarvis so that Jarvis can set up your GitHub team and repositories automatically. This will also add you to Jarvis' autograding system. During registration, you can also opt-in to **Scoreboard**.

1. Go to the [Jarvis](http://jarvis.xyz/)
2. Click on the **register** tab
3. Enter your UNI. If it gives you an error saying that you're not enrolled for the class, contact the Head TA [Linan Qiu lq2137@columbia.edu](mailto:lq2137@columbia.edu).
4. Choose whether you want to opt-in to the Scoreboard.
5. Click on **GitHub Login**. This will bring you to GitHub where you will have to give permission to Jarvis.
6. If for any reason this fails, email the Head TA [Linan Qiu lq2137@columbia.edu](mailto:lq2137@columbia.edu).

You should now be apart of the CS3134 Organization and should have access to a few different repositories:
- You should now have a repository setup just for your homework solutions. This should be located in the CS3134 organization and be called `homework-<uni>`. This is what you'll setup in the next section to allow you to write your homework answers and submit them. If the above didn't work, contact one of the TAs to help you out.
- You should also have access to the other public / organization-only repositories for homework solutions, notes, admin etc.

You should have also received an email with your nickname. If for any reason you don't receive the confirmation email, email the Head TA [Linan Qiu lq2137@columbia.edu](mailto:lq2137@columbia.edu).

**Finally, check your email and accept an invitation to join the cs3134 team on GitHub. This is critical. You need to do this to have the right permissions to access homeworks.**

### Install Git

Install Git by following the instructions here for your operating system: [https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

Then, set up your authentication keys here: [https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/).

If you wan to learn more about Git, check out this very handy video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE)

### Setting Up Homeworks

You should have finished creating an account on GitHub, registering with Jarvis, and installing Git.

You should download [https://github.com/cs3134/admin/blob/master/setup.sh](https://github.com/cs3134/admin/blob/master/setup.sh) and run the `.sh` file.

#### Mac

You need to download the Admin zip from GitHub [https://github.com/cs3134/admin](https://github.com/cs3134/admin):

That link points to the cs3134/admin repo on GitHub. To download it, click the link on the bottom right of the screen 'Download ZIP'.

Unzip it, then drag the `setup.sh` to a folder where you want your homework files to be, open up Terminal, `cd` into the directory where the `setup.sh` is, and run

```bash
$ sh setup.sh <youruni>
```

For example, for me, I'd run

```bash
$ sh setup.sh lq2137
```

You should see a series of commands being run.

```
âžœ  admin git:(master) sh setup.sh lq2137
Cloning into 'homework-master'...

Everything up-to-date
```

If you want to use Eclipse, simply import the entire `homework-<youruni>` directory as a project. The guide to using Eclipse is here: [https://github.com/cs3134/admin/blob/master/eclipse.md](https://github.com/cs3134/admin/blob/master/eclipse.md)

#### Linux

Do pretty much the same as the Mac people.

If you use Eclipse, this guide will be useful for importing projects: [https://github.com/cs3134/admin/blob/master/eclipse.md](https://github.com/cs3134/admin/blob/master/eclipse.md)

#### Windows

(Contributed by [Windows Guru Nick Mariconda nm2812@columbia.edu](mailto:nm2812@columbia.edu))

Setting things up on Windows is not quite as straightforward, but fortunately there are plenty of tools available to help you out. 

The simplest way to do it is by installing Git Desktop. Git Desktop provides a Git Shell on which you can run setup.sh (it's basically powershell + git, for those of you familiar with powershell). 

Download it from the following link: https://desktop.github.com/

Once you've downloaded it, you should see Git Desktop and Git Shell icons on your desktop. Open the Git Shell icon and it should open a command-line interface in a directory that looks similar to this:

	C:\Users\nick\Documents\GitHub
	
(you can also access the Git Shell from the Git Desktop Gui that should come up right after installation -- click the gear on the top right corner, and then click 'Open in Git Shell')
	
You want to copy and paste the setup.sh script to that directory. Here's how you do that:

First, you need to download the Admin zip from GitHub: https://github.com/cs3134/admin

That link points to the cs3134/admin repo on GitHub. To download it, click the link on the bottom right of the screen 'Download ZIP'.

A File Explorer window should pop up with an 'admin-master' folder. Enter the folder and you should find the 'setup' shell script. Copy it, and now you can paste it right into the directory specified earlier.

Now go back to your Git Shell command prompt and enter the command 'ls'. You should see setup.sh in there. If you don't, something went wrong. Recheck your steps, and ask for help on Piazza if you can't figure it out.

Run setup.sh:

```bash
./setup.sh <UNI>
```
eg. `./setup.sh nm2812`

Note: some students have difficulty running the script in this way. If it doesn't work, try this:

```bash
sh setup.sh <youruni>
```

If the script runs correctly, you should see some output. Enter the 'ls' command again, and you should now see a `homework-<youruni>` directory, as well as the setup.sh file. If you see that, the setup ran successfully and you're ready to complete homework 0.

The files that lie in this `homework-<youruni>` directory are ultimately the ones that you will be modifying and submitting. You're free to compile and run your code on any platform you wish. I recommend using Eclipse. Here's how to get Eclipse to modify the files in this directory:

Open up Eclipse and create a new Java Project. Uncheck the box marked "Use default location". Instead of using that, we're going to have the project point directly to homework 0 directory created after running the setup.sh script. In the 'location' field, enter the directory path to HW0. Mine looks like this:

C:\Users\nick\Documents\GitHub\homework-nm2812\0

(you should note this is straight from the directory created after running the setup.sh script)

Make sure to give the project a sensible name (the name defaults to '0', which is actually illegal).

Once the project is created from within Eclipse, you should have no problem finding the Jarvis3134.java file and making the required change for homework 0. 

When you're ready to submit your homework, return to the git shell and enter the following command:

```bash
cd homework-<youruni>/0
```

This will take you to the '0' folder in the homework directory. The instructions for HW0 specify how to commit and submit through git from here.

This should (hopefully) be straightforward, but getting Windows to behave like Unix can sometimes be a pain. If anything goes wrong and you can't get it to work, make a post on Piazza and the TA team will assist you!


Note: For those of you wondering, Git Shell isn't the only way a Windows user can dabble in a Unix-like environment. All these steps could be completed with Cygwin (pronounced sig-win), which is a powerful Unix-like environment and command-line interface for Windows. It's a great idea for Windows users to get familiar with it. The setup may be a bit more complicated, but you should give it a try if you have some free time -- Cygwin is a powerful tool with applications that extend far beyond merely using Git. 

You can install it from here: https://cygwin.com/install.html


#### Manual Installation

1. Clone the current homework repository by issuing the following commands onto the command line in a directory where you want the homeworks to be:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cs3134/homework-master.git
```

It will make a complete replica of the homework repository locally. 

If you get an error that looks like:

```bash
Cloning into 'homework'...
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

More likely the cause is that you just haven't finished setting up your GitHub account. You just need to [setup an SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) to allow pushing and pulling over HTTPS.

2. Now we are going to change it to point to your personal repository that was created for you in the previous section (so that you don't end up submitting to the master repository and getting rejected permission errors). If you're curious, here's whats happening:

Originally, when you clone the repository, the local repository is a "copy" of the `cs3134/homework-master.git`. That means when you push code, you are pushing to that repository.

```
your local folder -------> cs3134/homework-master.git
```

```
your local folder ----     cs3134/homework-master.git
                     |---> cs3134/homework-<youruni>.git
```

How we do that is as follows:

Assuming that you've just cloned the folder, then let's rename that folder and go into it:

```bash
$ mv homework-master homework-<youruni>
$ cd homework-<youruni>
```

By default the remote called `origin` is set to the location that you cloned the repository from. You should see the following:

```bash
$ git remote -v
origin https://github.com/cs3134/homework-master.git (fetch)
origin https://github.com/cs3134/homework-master.git (push)
```

We don't want that remote to be the origin, instead, we want to change it to point to your repository. To do that, issue the following command:

```bash
$ git remote rename origin upstream
```

And now you should see the following:

```bash
$ git remote -v
upstream https://github.com/cs3134/homework-master.git (fetch)
upstream https://github.com/cs3134/homework-master.git (push)
```

4. Lastly we need to give your repository a new `origin` since it is lacking
   one. Issue the following but substituting your GitHub username in place:

```bash
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/cs3134/homework-<youruni>.git
```

But substitute in your own UNI of course.

If you have an error that looks like the following:

```
Could not rename config section 'remote.[old name]' to 'remote.[new name]'
```

Or this error:

```
fatal: remote origin already exists.
```

This appears to happen to some depending on the version of Git they are using. To fix it, just issue the following command:

```bash
$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/cs3134/homework-<youruni>.git
```

For reference, your final `git remote -v` should look like following when its setup correctly:

```bash
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/cs3134/homework-<youruni> (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/cs3134/homework-<youruni> (push)
upstream    https://github.com/cs3134/homework-master.git (fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/cs3134/homework-master.git (push)
```

4. Let's test it out by doing a push of your master branch to GitHub by issuing
   the following:

```bash
$ git push -u -f origin master
```

   You should see something like the following:

```
Counting objects: 5, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 294 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/cs3134/homework-<youruni>.git   f726472..545a4f0  master -> master
```

5. That last command was a bit special and only needs to be ran the first time to setup the remote tracking branches. Now we should be able to just run `git push` without the arguments. Try it and you should get the following:

```bash
$ git push
Everything up-to-date
```

If you don't know Git that well, this probably seemed very arcane. Just keep
using Git and you'll keep understanding more and more.
